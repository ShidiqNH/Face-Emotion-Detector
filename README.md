# Face-Emotion-Detector

This project is a real-time facial emotion recognition system that uses a webcam to detect faces and predict emotions. The system classifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more using a pre-trained deep learning model. The application is built with OpenCV for video capture and face detection, and TensorFlow/Keras for emotion classification.

This project was developed to fulfill the final assignment for the Artificial Intelligence course. It demonstrates the implementation of a real-time facial emotion recognition system using a webcam and a pre-trained deep learning model.
